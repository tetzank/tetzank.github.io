There are genuine reasons for that. Macros might look like functions but they behave differently, resulting in confusing bugs when not treated carefully. But even in modern C++, macros still have their use cases. In this post, I want to talk about a special kind of macro called X-macro which is mostly used to generate various code fragments from a single list of elements.</p></div></a><a href=https://tetzank.github.io/posts/identical-code-folding/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2019-01-07 09:51:00 &#43;0100 CET" class=catalogue-time>2019-01-07</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Identical Code Folding</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Even more interesting than removing unused functions is consolidating identical instances of templated functions. For each template parameter, the compiler generates a new instance. In case of templated classes, it generates code per template parameter for every member function. The instances can have identical code, e.g., the member function is independent of the template parameters or the types are semantically equivalent for the applied operations. Let&rsquo;s see if we can minimize the code explosion by deduplicating code when it is identical.</p></div></a><a href=https://tetzank.github.io/posts/removing-unused-code/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2019-01-05 23:25:03 &#43;0100 CET" class=catalogue-time>2019-01-05</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Removing Unused Code</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>I recently went on a little journey to get a better understanding of the linker used in C++. Like many other C++ developers, my mental model of what the linker actually does is very limited. But I&rsquo;m always interested in learning new tricks about the tools I use regularly, especially new optimizations slumbering behind some obscure flag. In this post, we will have a look at the removal of unused functions from the executable and how the linker can help us with this task.</p></div></a></div><div class=pagination><span>1</span></div></main></div></body></html>
