00:24.500 --> 00:28.500
We sent out the SOS call.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.500
It was a quarter past four in the morning

00:33.500 --> 00:37.500
when the storm broke our second anchor line.

00:38.500 --> 00:45.500
Four months at sea, four months of calm seas to be pounded

00:45.500 --> 00:51.000
in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point.

00:52.200 --> 00:57.500
They call them rogues, they travel fast and alone.

00:57.500 --> 01:03.500
One-hundred-foot faces of God's good ocean gone wrong.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.700
What they call love is a risk,

01:06.700 --> 01:10.700
cause you will always get hit out of nowhere

01:10.700 --> 01:16.500
by some wave and end up on your own.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.500
The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts

01:28.100 --> 01:31.000
to bail us out.

01:34.500 --> 01:40.000
And flooded the engines and radio

01:40.000 --> 01:43.500
and half buried bow.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.500
Your tongue is a rudder.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.000
It steers the whole ship.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.200
Sends your words past your lips

02:07.200 --> 02:11.000
or keeps them safe behind your teeth.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.600
But the wrong words will strand you.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.500
Come off course while you sleep.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.300
Sweep your boat out to sea

02:19.300 --> 02:23.000
or dashed to bits on the reef.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.400
The vessel groans the ocean pressures its frame.

02:30.400 --> 02:36.100
To the port I see the lighthouse through the sleet and rain.

02:36.100 --> 02:42.700
And I wish for one more day to give my love and repay debts.

02:42.700 --> 02:49.500
But the morning finds our bodies washed up thirty miles west.

02:55.500 --> 03:01.000
They say that the captain stays fast with the ship

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
through still and storm.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
But this ain't the Dakota, and the water is cold.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.500
We won't have to fight for long.

NOTE
(This is the end)

03:28.200 --> 03:36.000
This story's old but it goes on and on until we disappear

NOTE
(This is the calm)

03:36.000 --> 03:44.300
Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed while you were underneath

NOTE
(We are the risen)

03:44.300 --> 03:52.200
I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains sunk below the sea

NOTE
(After the storm)

03:52.200 --> 03:55.900
I spoke the words but never

03:55.900 --> 04:00.700
gave a thought to what they all could mean

NOTE
(Rest in the deep)

04:00.700 --> 04:04.300
I know that this is what you want

04:04.300 --> 04:08.600
A funeral keeps both of us apart

NOTE
(Washed up on the beach)

04:08.600 --> 04:12.400
You know that you are not alone

04:12.400 --> 04:17.000
I need you like water in my lungs

NOTE
(This is the end)

04:17.000 --> 04:25.100
This story's old but it goes on and on until we disappear

NOTE
(This is the calm)

04:25.100 --> 04:33.300
Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed while you were underneath

NOTE
(We are the risen)

04:33.300 --> 04:41.300
I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains sunk below the sea

NOTE
(After the storm)

04:41.300 --> 04:44.700
I spoke the words but never

04:44.700 --> 04:49.400
gave a thought to what they all could mean

NOTE
(Rest in the deep)

04:49.400 --> 04:53.200
I know that this is what you want

04:53.200 --> 04:57.500
A funeral keeps both of us apart

NOTE
(Washed up on the beach)

04:57.500 --> 05:01.500
You know that you are not alone

05:01.500 --> 05:07.000
I need you like water in my lungs
