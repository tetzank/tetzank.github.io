They provide an expressive yet compact way to match long and complex paths in a data graph by utilizing regular expressions. In this paper, we systematically explore and analyze the design space for the data structures involved in automaton-based RPQ evaluation. We consider three fundamental data structures used during RPQ processing: adjacency lists for quick neighborhood exploration, visited data structure for cycle detection, and the representation of intermediate results. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on realistic graph data sets and systematically investigate various alternative data structure representations and implementation variants. We show that carefully crafted data structures which exploit the access pattern of RPQs lead to reduced peak memory consumption and evaluation time.</p><p>DATA 2018,

They allow the definition of recursive path structures through regular expressions in a declarative pattern matching environment. We study the use of the K2-tree graph compression technique to materialize RPQ results with low memory consumption for indexing. Compact index representations enable the efficient storage of multiple indexes for varying RPQs.</p><p>GRADES 2017,
