working in the field of databases, particularly graph databases.
Other fields of interest include everything related to writing fast code,
and the tools that help me get there.
C/C++ is my language of choice as it gives me precise control of what is
actually executed.
I like to dig deep to understand the performance characteristics of a program.
Sometimes that leads to reading and writing assembly for fun and profit.
It is like a jigsaw puzzle: it can be very tiresome to assemble all pieces,
but it is marvelous when everything falls into place.
Nothing is better than the feeling of beating the compiler in an (unfair)
competition.</p><p>On this website, I will mostly write about my adventures in the C++ landscape,
tutorials about tools and libraries I find interesting.
Other interesting topics from computer science might also find their way here.
We will see.
I am still in the process of getting the hang of this &ldquo;blog thing&rdquo;.
We know where we are headed after the first steps, I guess.</p></article></main></div></body></html>
